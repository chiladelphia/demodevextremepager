  "name": "Record Paging - DevExtreme Data Grid",
  "main": "src/app/app.component.ts",
  "description": "The DataGrid splits records into multiple pages. This technique helps optimize control performance: the client only needs to load and render one page at a time. Users can use a scroll bar or a pager to navigate between pages. This demo shows how to enable and customize the pager.\nThe pager is configured in the pager object and contains the following elements:\n\n\nPage navigator\nEnables page navigation.\n\n\nPage size selector\nChanges the page size. To display this element, enable the showPageSizeSelector property. You can also define the allowedPageSizes and specify the initial pageSize in the paging object.\n\n\nPage information\nDisplays the current page number and total record count. To display page information, enable the showInfo property. You can also use the infoText property to customize the information text string.\n\n\nThe pager supports full, compact, and adaptive (default) display modes. In compact mode, the pager hides page information and changes the appearance of other elements to use screen space more efficiently. In adaptive mode, the pager automatically chooses between the full and compact modes based on the DataGrid's width. Use the displayMode property to switch between modes.\nIn this demo, you can use the drop-down Display Mode menu to switch between full and compact display modes. You can also use the checkboxes to hide or display different pager elements. Note that when the pager is in compact mode, navigation buttons are always visible but page information is hidden.\n",
